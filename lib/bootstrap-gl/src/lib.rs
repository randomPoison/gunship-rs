//! Provides a Rust binding to the OpenGL API.
//!
//! This library attempts to provide a complete set of bindings to the OpenGL API while providing
//! a small boost in type-safety over the raw OpenGL API. This library does not abstract the OpenGL
//! API in any way, and in many cases still leaves the task of catching error cases to the
//! programmer. This is meant to be used by other libraries to build higher-level abstractions over
//! raw OpenGL.
//!
//! # Safety Improvements
//!
//! The primary way that `gl-util` improves on the raw OpenGL is by replacing `GLEnum` function
//! parameters with special enum types that only contain variants that are valid options for that
//! function.
